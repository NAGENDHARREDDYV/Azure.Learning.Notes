##Azure Table Storage
- a non relational database system in the Azure
- items stores in these tables do not need a specific schema
- depending on requirement, it can be great alternative to a relational database system
- great performance at low cost
- this is not a good one when you need complex joins, datasets , stored procedures etc


##how it works

Storage Account(Nag2604) -> Tables(Orders/Users etc tables) -> Entities (examples : [OrderID,Date,ItemName] or [Name,Mobile,Email])

Entities - collection of properties (just like record in a database)
each entity is going to have multiple properties made up of key value pairs
Single entity can have up to 252 properties to store information

Entities:
Each item in every table in Azure storage to ever build should have a Partition Key and a Row Key.

Partition key - gives a way to shard( horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine) data across multiple 
back end servers.
Example :
PartitionKey: Overnight
RoWKey:34
Date:8/21/18
ItemName:Item #11

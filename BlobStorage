Blob Storage: 

Overview: 

Blob : Binary large object
Blob is for storage of large amount of unstructured text or images or videos or disk images or binary data. (similar to S3 in AWS).
You need a storage account first
The account name is globally unique

All the files stored, are accessible from storage service using a public HTTP url, and the name of the storage account name is the first portion of that address.
example: https://Nagendharstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net

Once you have storage account, you create containers under neath the storage account to hold your blobs
Storage account -> Container -> blobs

Nagendharstorageaccount -> a container for images / a container for videos etc -> inside images container you will have images(there are blobs)


Nagendharstorageaccount -> Imagescontainer-> image1.png,image2.png
Nagendharstorageaccount -> Videoscontainer -> video1.mp4, video2.mp4

to access the url format : https://Nagendharstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/imagescontainer/image1.png 


Three diff blob types:
Page blobs - to store virtual hard disks, they are optimised for random read/write operations
Block blobs -  to store images, videos etc . comprised of mutiple blocks of data, can break data into mutiple chunks/blocks for multipart upload.
Append Blobs - used for text files /log files  where its common to appending a line item at the end of file. 

Creating Storage Account:

Need a unique name 

Access tier : 
Cool - for less freq access data, you pay less
Hot - for more freq access data

Account kind : General purpose vs Blob storage 
if blob storage : you will have both cool and hot and you wont be able to work with table storage or storage keys, strictly for storing blobs
if GP : hot/cool access tier wont be available
